# Matrix-Methods
Calculate guided wave dispersion diagrams for free anisotropic multilayered plates by using the transfer matrix method (TMM) or the stiffness matrix method (SMM). Using TMM, the numerical instability at high frequency-thickness products becomes obvious. By contrast, SMM remains stable.

Written in MATLAB R2022a.
